    <h1>An example of fluid typography using "locks"</h1>

    <h2>Using media queries and a formula involving minimum and maximum viewport widths, relative units and vw units</h2>

    <p>
    This approach gives you the greatest amount of control over the min/max font size at a min/max viewport width, as well as an elegantly fluid sizing between the min and max.
    And we can more closely match the responsive approach in terms of font-size to viewport width.
