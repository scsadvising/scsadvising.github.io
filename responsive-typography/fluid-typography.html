    <h2>Using relative units and vw (viewport width) units</h2>

    <p>
    This approach is fluidly responsive, and changing the browser base font size as well as zooming in/out works to resize the resulting font sizes.
    It doesn't exactly match the responsive approach, meaning the font sizes won't be exactly the same at a given viewport.
